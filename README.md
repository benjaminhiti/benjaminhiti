### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin Hitimana, and I am a **back-end developer** from Rwanda. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Technology. I am passionate about backend technologies. My core skills include JavaScript and Python. When I am not coding, I enjoy being active in technical communities and writing on my blog:  https://dev.to/benjaminhiti.

I would say that I am motivated by the desire and ambition to improve my standard of living by using the power of computer technology to solve and tackle our society's daily life problems while also meeting challenging deadlines.
